Code for our paper **'Attracting and Dispersing: A Simple Approach for Source-free Domain Adaptation'** 

[[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04183)


### Contributions
- We provide a _surprisingly simple_ solution for source-free domain adaptation, which is an upperbound of the proposed clustering objective:

- And we can relate several methods in domain adaptation, source-free domain adaptation and contrastive learning via the perspective of discriminability and diversity:

**We will release the code if accepted.**
